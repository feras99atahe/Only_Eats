## OnlyEats Flutter App: Architecture Design

### State Management: BLoC (Business Logic Component)

For the OnlyEats Flutter application, we will adopt the **BLoC (Business Logic Component)** architecture for state management. This choice is motivated by the following factors:

*   **Separation of Concerns:** BLoC promotes a clean separation between the UI (presentation layer) and the business logic. This makes the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and test.
*   **Scalability:** As the OnlyEats app grows in complexity with more features, BLoC's structured approach will help manage the state effectively without leading to unmanageable code.
*   **Testability:** With the business logic isolated in Blocs, it becomes straightforward to write unit tests for the app's core functionalities without needing to interact with the UI.
*   **Reactivity:** BLoC leverages streams to handle asynchronous operations and state changes, providing a reactive and efficient way to update the UI in response to events.

### Folder Structure

The project will follow a feature-driven folder structure. Each feature will have its own directory containing all the related files (e.g., screens, blocs, data models, repositories). This approach enhances modularity and makes it easier to navigate the codebase.

```
lib/
├── core/
│   ├── network/
│   ├── theme/
│   └── utils/
├── features/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── data/
│   │   │   ├── models/
│   │   │   └── repositories/
│   │   ├── domain/
│   │   │   ├── entities/
│   │   │   └── usecases/

│   │       ├── bloc/
│   │       ├── screens/
│   │       └── widgets/
│   ├── restaurant/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── order/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── profile/
│       └── ...
├── main.dart
└── app.dart
```

### Data Models and API Integration

*   **Data Models:** We will define data models (entities) to represent the data structures used in the app (e.g., User, Restaurant, MenuItem, Order). These models will be used to parse API responses and manage data within the app.
*   **API Integration:** A dedicated `network` layer will handle all API communications. We will use the `http` or `dio` package for making network requests. A repository pattern will be used to abstract the data sources (e.g., remote API, local cache) from the business logic.
