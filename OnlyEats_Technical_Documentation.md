## Executive Summary

The OnlyEats Flutter application represents a comprehensive food delivery platform designed to connect users with local restaurants through an intuitive mobile interface. This technical documentation provides detailed insights into the application's architecture, implementation strategies, and operational guidelines for development teams and stakeholders.

Built using Flutter framework with Dart programming language, the application employs the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management, ensuring scalable and maintainable code architecture. The application encompasses core functionalities including user authentication, restaurant browsing, menu exploration, order management, and user profile administration.

The development approach prioritizes clean architecture principles, separating concerns across presentation, domain, and data layers. This architectural decision facilitates easier testing, maintenance, and future feature expansion while maintaining code quality and performance standards.

## Project Overview

### Business Context

OnlyEats emerges as a strategic response to the growing demand for convenient food delivery services in the digital marketplace. The application serves as a bridge between hungry customers and local restaurants, providing a seamless ordering experience that benefits both parties in the transaction ecosystem.

The platform addresses several key market needs including restaurant discovery, menu accessibility, order tracking, and payment processing. By leveraging mobile technology, OnlyEats eliminates traditional barriers to food ordering while providing restaurants with expanded customer reach and streamlined order management capabilities.

### Technical Objectives

The primary technical objectives driving the OnlyEats development include creating a responsive and intuitive user interface, implementing robust state management for complex data flows, ensuring secure user authentication and data protection, and establishing scalable architecture for future growth.

Performance optimization remains a critical consideration throughout the development process, with particular attention to application startup times, smooth scrolling experiences, and efficient memory management. The application must maintain consistent performance across various device specifications and network conditions.

Cross-platform compatibility represents another fundamental objective, leveraging Flutter's capabilities to deliver native-like experiences on both iOS and Android platforms while maintaining a single codebase. This approach significantly reduces development time and maintenance overhead while ensuring feature parity across platforms.



## Architecture Design

### Overall System Architecture

The OnlyEats application follows a layered architecture pattern that promotes separation of concerns and maintainability. The architecture consists of three primary layers: Presentation Layer, Domain Layer, and Data Layer, each serving distinct responsibilities within the application ecosystem.

The Presentation Layer encompasses all user interface components, including screens, widgets, and state management logic. This layer handles user interactions, displays data, and manages the visual state of the application. Flutter widgets form the foundation of this layer, providing declarative UI construction and efficient rendering capabilities.

The Domain Layer contains the core business logic and entities that define the application's fundamental concepts. This layer remains independent of external frameworks and technologies, ensuring that business rules can be tested and modified without affecting other system components. Entities such as User, Restaurant, MenuItem, and Order represent the core data structures that drive application functionality.

The Data Layer manages external data sources, including API communications, local storage, and data transformation operations. This layer implements repository patterns to abstract data source details from the domain layer, enabling flexible data source switching and comprehensive testing strategies.

### State Management Architecture

The application employs the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management, providing a reactive and predictable approach to handling application state changes. BLoC separates business logic from UI components, creating a unidirectional data flow that simplifies debugging and testing processes.

Each major feature area includes dedicated BLoC implementations that manage specific state domains. The AuthBloc handles user authentication states, RestaurantBloc manages restaurant data and search functionality, CartBloc oversees shopping cart operations, and OrderBloc coordinates order placement and tracking activities.

Events trigger state changes within BLoC components, representing user actions or system events that require state modifications. States represent the current condition of specific application domains, providing immutable snapshots that UI components can consume for rendering purposes.

The BLoC pattern facilitates comprehensive testing by isolating business logic from UI components. Unit tests can verify state transitions and business rule implementations without requiring UI rendering, while widget tests can focus on user interaction scenarios and visual behavior verification.

### Data Flow Architecture

Data flows through the application following a unidirectional pattern that ensures predictable state management and simplified debugging processes. User interactions generate events that BLoC components process to produce new states, which UI components consume to update their visual representations.

API communications follow a repository pattern that abstracts external data source details from business logic components. Repository implementations handle network requests, data transformation, error handling, and caching strategies while providing clean interfaces for domain layer consumption.

Local data persistence utilizes Flutter's built-in capabilities for storing user preferences, authentication tokens, and cached data. The data layer manages these storage operations transparently, ensuring that business logic components remain focused on core functionality rather than storage implementation details.

Error handling strategies permeate all architectural layers, providing graceful degradation and user-friendly error messages when system failures occur. Network connectivity issues, API errors, and data validation failures receive appropriate handling to maintain application stability and user experience quality.

### Security Architecture

Security considerations influence architectural decisions throughout the application, particularly in areas involving user authentication, data transmission, and local data storage. The application implements industry-standard security practices to protect user information and maintain system integrity.

User authentication employs secure token-based mechanisms that minimize exposure of sensitive credentials during transmission and storage. Authentication tokens receive appropriate lifecycle management, including automatic renewal and secure storage practices that prevent unauthorized access.

Data transmission security utilizes HTTPS protocols for all API communications, ensuring that sensitive information remains encrypted during network transit. Certificate pinning and other advanced security measures can be implemented to further enhance communication security in production environments.

Local data storage follows secure practices for sensitive information, utilizing platform-specific secure storage mechanisms for authentication tokens and other confidential data. Non-sensitive data receives appropriate protection through standard storage practices and access controls.
